# objectDetection

Install Python Libraries
pip install opencv

For Object Detection I have used a Mobilenet SSD V1 coco model so that it can run on cpu.

The detection of objects are 97% accurate.

I have added a models in the repository, so don't need to find the models. 

to run the file: python3 objDetect.py
